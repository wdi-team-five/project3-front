Our website is called IAI which stands for Inconsistent Array Indices (our team name). It is a content management system where users can create accounts, upload files and see them on their profile. They can also see tags associated with their files.

Users who are registered and logged in can upload files and folders. They can see their profile information, view the files and folders they have uploaded, and see the content.

Visitors who are not registered or logged in cannot do anything but view the homepage and see the empty boxes on the profile page.

We used HTML/CSS, jQuery and AJAX on the front end to create a functional and responsive website.

Our goals for this site in the future is to allow users to update and delete their profiles, and improve the UI/UX for the document list/when users are in folders.

We used user stories to create our site functions. (link below)

Simple wireframes are attached below, we stuck to them for the most part with small adjustments as we saw how information needed to be displayed.
